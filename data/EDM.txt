Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone

It won't heal, it never fades away
I'll go crazy, now you're gone

Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

I gave you a part of me
When life was free
The love was inside of us
But I let it be

Now I see what a fool I've been
And I feel what it means
To send you away like that
And never hold you again!

You're in my eyes, in my head
In my soul I feel you there!
Oh Camilla light this world again, woah

All my night, everyday
I've been calling out your name
Oh Camilla life got right again
Life got right again!

###Angel In The Night
You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Your hair is dancing in the wind
Your eyes are burning up my skin
And I'm so happy when I see
That you are smiling back at me

You're leaving burn marks on the ground
Thank You, God, for what I've found
I don't know how, I don't know why
But you're my angel in the night

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now
Just like days before you start to cry

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Prepare for lunch in three, two, one

I try my best to satisfy
But all you do is wave me goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I'm so crazy about you

Even if I don't know where to start
Even if my love is tearing me apart
I just know that you and me
We were always meant to be

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now
Just like days before you start to cry

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Three, two, one
You're my angel in the night

###Love You More
You can make the sea turn purple
You can make the seeds unfertile
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

You can make the sea turn purple
You can make the seeds unfertile
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

When I'm dreaming I'm alone with you
Lying in my lonely bed
Ohh the times you held me in your arms
And all our fantasies we shared

No ones touch my body like you do
Not in that special way
'Cause I've found your love
And it feels so right so don't let me go

Baby I'm your dream girl

I'm like your world, I'm your dream girl
Believe me baby it's true
I wanna be with you

The way I walk, the way I look

I'm like your world, I'm your dream girl
Believe me baby it's true
I wanna be with you

The way I walk, the way I look
Hands all over me
Baby I'm your dream girl

When you hold me in your arms
You made me feel so safe
Everyone told me to walk away
But don't you say why I stay

No ones touch my body like you do
Not in that special way
'Cause I've found your love
And it feels so right so don't let me go

I'm like your world, I'm your dream girl
Believe me baby it's true
I wanna be with you

The way I walk, the way I look
Hands all over me
Baby I'm your dream girl
