It's a first page of the second chapter

I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Coming down on the floor like a maniac
I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Get down in full effect
I want you back for the rhythm-attack
Coming down on the floor like a maniac
I want you back, so clean up the dish
By the way, how much is the fish?
How much is the fish?

Here we go, here we go,

We're breaking the rules
Ignore the machine
You won't ever stop this
The chase...is better than a catch!

Been searching for a place called home.
